# Social Media Hex Gallery

Single page application that copies the hex color values of various popular social media sites to the user's clipboard.
This is done when the user clicks on a specific module for each site's theme.

With responsive design in mind, I utilized Bootstrap's mobile-first grid system to allow for a fluid mobile experience.
Functionality and animation were developed primarily with jQuery and some vanilla Javascript.

Additionally, I used the "const" type instead of the traditional "var" which was introduced is ES6.
This was done to ensure immutability and utilize const's block level scope.
